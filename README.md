# Process Control Block Simulator

This repository contains a **Process Control Block (PCB) Simulator** developed as the final project for **Semester 6** in the course **BSCS-502: Concepts of Operating Systems**. The project demonstrates the implementation of the **Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm** through an interactive and visually simulated interface.

## Key Features

1. **Round Robin Scheduling**:
   - Simulates process scheduling using a fixed quantum size.
   - Displays the execution of processes with status updates (`Running`, `Ready`, `Completed`).

2. **Dynamic Process Management**:
   - Add processes dynamically with **arrival time** and **execution time** inputs.
   - Set **quantum size** to control process switching.

3. **Real-Time Logs**:
   - Generates detailed execution logs for each process.
   - Logs include **execution time**, **remaining time**, **status**, **clock time**, and **program counter (PC)** updates.

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Built using **React.js** and styled with **Material-UI** for a clean, responsive design.
   - User-friendly input validation and feedback using **SweetAlert2**.

5. **Interactive Simulation**:
   - Step-by-step visualization of process execution and scheduling in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (React.js for UI development)
- **Material-UI** (For modern and responsive UI components)
- **SweetAlert2** (For interactive and user-friendly alerts)

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained in-depth knowledge of **Process Control Blocks** and their role in operating system design.
- Understood and implemented the **Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm**.
- Improved skills in front-end development and real-time process simulation using JavaScript frameworks.
- Learned to handle **dynamic inputs** and **log generation** for system process simulations.
